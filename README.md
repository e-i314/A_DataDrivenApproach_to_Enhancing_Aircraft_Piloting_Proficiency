# Project Overview

This repository contains code and datasets for analysis involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Bayesian Networks, as well as simulations based on the Bayesian Networks' regression analysis.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Description
This section includes Python code for performing PCA on flight data.

### Contents
- **Code:** The Jupyter notebook `01_主成分分析.ipynb` located in the `01_PCA` folder.
- **Environment:** Python 3.8.5
- **Data:**
  - `straight_rev1.csv` - Contains the flight data.
  - `属性情報.csv` - Contains attributes of subjects.

## Bayesian Network

### Description
Implementation of a Bayesian Network in R to learn the structure from data automatically.

### Contents
- **Code:** The R Markdown file `連続ベイジアンネットワーク構造学習_自動操縦データ.Rmd` located in the `2_BayesianNetwork` folder.
- **Language:** R
- **Data:**
  - `auto_straight_flagnameinfo_meanstd_light.csv` - Autopilot data used for Bayesian Network modeling.

## Simulation

### Description
Using the regression analysis results from Bayesian Networks, simulations are performed in Excel. Each varying element is manipulated in separate files to observe different outcomes.

### Contents
- **Folder:** All simulation-related files are located in the `3_Simulation` folder.
